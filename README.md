# IT314_project_17
## A platform for creating and managing online polls and surveys.

## Description:
- In the current scenario where data is the next fuel of the world, many people need the customer data, feedback, suggestions to start a new thing or even update the current products. It helps academicians to collect data for research projects. It helps a concerned person to get the public input on something while he/she is trying to bring or implement something new in the market.
- It will be a user-friendly platform where we can create polls & surveys and also share that data with that. 
- There should be a dedicated analysis section after the polls where we can get a conclusion after that.
- It helps conducting public or private surveys according to need.
- Also, online polling and surveys help reach a wide range of people as physical interaction is not always an option
